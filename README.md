# Upgrade Installer

## Description

First let's create an MSI installer for our application having version 1.0.0.0.

Next, we release the version 2.0.0.0 of the installer.

How should the installer be configured in order to be able to recognize the previous installation and upgrade the application instead of installing it again?

## Question

- How to configure the upgrade support for an MSI installer?
